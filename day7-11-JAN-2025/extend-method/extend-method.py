Hereâ€™s a practical example of using the extend() method in a DevOps scenario. 
The extend() method is used to add multiple items (from another iterable, 
like a list) to the end of an existing list.

using extend() to Update server inventory
Suppose you have a list of server currently in production, and you need to add new server from currently provisioned
batch to the list.
